		<h4>Bio</h4>
		<hr class="solid">
		<p class="align-left">Isaac Dunlop is a second-year college student, enrolled in the multimedia production program but focused on the web, graphic, and scripting sides. Isaac’s name means “laughter,” therefore it’s only natural that he laughs lots. He enjoys sharing those laughs with others and spreading joy to his friends and family.
		Outside of school, Isaac enjoys spending time with family and friends. He tends to spend a lot of his time either on his PC or, out and about in the 2007 Honda Civic that he owns. As for hobbies, Isaac enjoys coding websites in HTML and CSS. At the same time, he enjoys making his own graphics to go with the websites. Isaac used to be quite involved in sports both inside and outside of school. However, he hasn’t been active in any sports team for several years now. Isaac’s coolest travel experience was when he travelled out to Cuba with his family for a wedding.<br><br>
		Currently, he’s working on an e-commerce website outside of school and is going to attempt to build his own business. Speaking of websites, Isaac once was told by a friend back when he was only in grade 9, to make a YouTube channel that would feature only the best of memes. His first video reached over 7.5 thousand viewers and had Isaac excited to make more.<br><br>
		Isaac gets his inspiration from a variety of sources. When it comes to coding/programming, he gets it all from an older cousin named Darren. In the aspect of art, his inspiration comes from dad who is a very talented artist. If Isaac were to relate to anyone from the many movies he has watched, it would be Saul Silver, from Pineapple Express.</p>
