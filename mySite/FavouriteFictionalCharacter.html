		<h2>Quotes</h2>
		<p>
			<blockquote>
				"All I have in this world is my balls and my word, and I don't break 'em for no one!"
				<br>
				"You don't have the guts to be what you wanna' be! You need people like me so you can point your f***in' fingers and say, 'That's the bad guy!'"
				<br>
				"Okay, here's the story. I come from the gutter. I know that. I got no education, but that's okay. I know the street, and I'm making all the right connections. With the right woman, there's no stopping me. I could go right to the top."
